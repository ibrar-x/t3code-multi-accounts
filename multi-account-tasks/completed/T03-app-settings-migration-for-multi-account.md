## Task
- [x] Run task-focused functional validation for behavior introduced in this task (not generic page smoke checks).
- [x] Execute positive, negative, and regression scenarios tied to this task's touched files and APIs.
- [x] Use the right test surface for this task: unit/integration/RPC tests first; add Playwright for UI behavior changed by this task.
- [x] If Playwright is used, validate end-to-end feature behavior and resulting state changes (not screenshot-only checks).
- [x] Write functional test report: `multi-account-tasks/reports/T03-playwright-report.md` (include scenarios, expected vs actual outcomes, commands run, evidence paths, failures, and fixes).
- [x] Create a dedicated branch before starting: `git checkout -b branch-t03-app-settings-migration-for-multi-account`
- [x] After implementation and all required tests pass, commit changes on this task branch.
- [x] Push the task branch to remote: `git push -u origin <task-branch>`
- [x] Merge this task branch into `main` after tests pass so the next task starts from the combined codebase.
- [x] Before starting the next task, pull latest `main` and create the next `branch-*` from it.
- [x] Read: `FEATURE-01-contracts-and-types.md`
- [x] Add `multiAccount` to app settings with safe decode defaults (no settings wipe).
- [x] Add/adjust tests for migration behavior.
- [x] Touch:
  - `apps/web/src/appSettings.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/appSettings.test.ts`


## Functional Scenarios (Must Pass)

- [ ] Validate legacy settings (without `multiAccount`) decode with safe defaults and no data loss.
- [ ] Validate existing settings fields are preserved after migration writeback.
- [ ] Validate malformed `multiAccount` values fall back safely without wiping unrelated preferences.
- [ ] Validate settings round-trip (decode -> mutate -> encode) remains stable.

## Quality Gates
- [x] `bun run lint`
- [x] `bun run typecheck`
- [x] `bun run test`
- [x] Task-focused functional validation completed for this task (including non-UI behavior), and report updated.

## Completion Checks
- [x] All ordered tasks complete.
- [x] All new methods/types are contract-aligned across server and web.
- [x] No regression in existing codex-only flows.
- [x] Quality gates pass.
