## Task
- [x] Run task-focused functional validation for behavior introduced in this task (not generic page smoke checks).
- [x] Execute positive, negative, and regression scenarios tied to this task's touched files and APIs.
- [x] Use the right test surface for this task: unit/integration/RPC tests first; add Playwright for UI behavior changed by this task.
- [x] If Playwright is used, validate end-to-end feature behavior and resulting state changes (not screenshot-only checks).
- [x] Write functional test report: `multi-account-tasks/reports/T09-playwright-report.md` (include scenarios, expected vs actual outcomes, commands run, evidence paths, failures, and fixes).
- [x] Create a dedicated branch before starting: `git checkout -b branch-t09-settings-ui-account-manager-panel`
- [x] After implementation and all required tests pass, commit changes on this task branch.
- [x] Push the task branch to remote: `git push -u origin <task-branch>`
- [x] Merge this task branch into `main` after tests pass so the next task starts from the combined codebase.
- [x] Before starting the next task, pull latest `main` and create the next `branch-*` from it.
- [x] Read: `FEATURE-08-settings-ui.md`
- [x] Implement account management panel UI and connect to account RPC methods.
- [x] Add add/remove/rename/set-active flows and error display.
- [x] Mount panel in settings route.
- [x] Touch:
  - `apps/web/src/components/AccountManagerPanel.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/components/AccountManagerPanel.test.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/web/src/routes/_chat.settings.tsx`


## Functional Scenarios (Must Pass)

- [x] Validate panel loads account list and supported-provider metadata from the account API.
- [x] Validate add/remove/rename/set-active actions produce correct backend mutations and UI refresh state.
- [x] Validate provider-specific login/check status is shown accurately after operations.
- [x] Validate error/retry behavior for failing account operations (network, validation, auth failure).

## Quality Gates
- [x] `bun run lint`
- [x] `bun run typecheck`
- [x] `bun run test`
- [x] Task-focused functional validation completed for this task (including non-UI behavior), and report updated.

## Completion Checks
- [x] All ordered tasks complete.
- [x] All new methods/types are contract-aligned across server and web.
- [x] No regression in existing codex-only flows.
- [x] Quality gates pass.
