## Task
- [x] Run task-focused functional validation for behavior introduced in this task (not generic page smoke checks).
- [x] Execute positive, negative, and regression scenarios tied to this task's touched files and APIs.
- [x] Use the right test surface for this task: unit/integration/RPC tests first; add Playwright for UI behavior changed by this task.
- [x] If Playwright is used, validate end-to-end feature behavior and resulting state changes (not screenshot-only checks).
- [x] Write functional test report: `multi-account-tasks/reports/T05-playwright-report.md` (include scenarios, expected vs actual outcomes, commands run, evidence paths, failures, and fixes).
- [x] Create a dedicated branch before starting: `git checkout -b branch-t05-account-store-and-account-manager`
- [ ] After implementation and all required tests pass, commit changes on this task branch.
- [ ] Push the task branch to remote: `git push -u origin <task-branch>`
- [ ] Merge this task branch into `main` after tests pass so the next task starts from the combined codebase.
- [ ] Before starting the next task, pull latest `main` and create the next `branch-*` from it.
- [x] Read: `FEATURE-04-account-manager.md`
- [x] Implement account persistence/state helpers.
- [x] Implement account manager CRUD/login/check/remove/session-env API.
- [x] Add tests for add/remove/check and cleanup on failed login.
- [x] Touch:
  - `apps/server/src/accounts/accountStore.ts` (new)
  - `apps/server/src/accounts/accountManager.ts` (new)
  - `apps/server/src/accounts/accountManager.test.ts` (new)


## Functional Scenarios (Must Pass)

- [x] Validate account add/list/remove/check workflows persist correctly across manager reloads.
- [x] Validate login/check failure cleanup leaves no partial account artifacts.
- [x] Validate duplicate/missing account operations return clear, deterministic errors.
- [x] Validate profile path/state cleanup after remove is complete and safe.

## Quality Gates
- [x] `bun run lint`
- [x] `bun run typecheck`
- [x] `bun run test`
- [x] Task-focused functional validation completed for this task (including non-UI behavior), and report updated.

## Completion Checks
- [x] All ordered tasks complete.
- [x] All new methods/types are contract-aligned across server and web.
- [x] No regression in existing codex-only flows.
- [x] Quality gates pass.
